The mage's records indicate a potential cure hidden deep within the Daelmoor Woods, but at a devastating cost.\n\nWith the rising chaos, Verenthia's neighbors wrestle for control over the cure, each aiming to manipulate it for their own ends, threatening to plunge Aldrion into an era of darkness and endless war.",

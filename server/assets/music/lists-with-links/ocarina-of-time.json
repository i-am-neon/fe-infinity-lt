They are accompanied by mellow strings and perhaps a solo violin that harmonizes with the voice, all creating a very tender and pastoral sound.",
    "situation": "Heard at Lon Lon Ranch and whenever Epona’s Song is played on the ocarina. It symbolizes Link’s friendship with Epona and the serene life at the ranch. Malon sings this to calm the animals, and the orchestral version retains that soothing, heartwarming feeling.",

    "songName": "Song of Storms",
    "description": "A mysterious and rhythmic waltz that gradually swells like a gathering storm. It starts off eerie and hypnotic, then intensifies, capturing both the gloom and the drama of a sudden downpour.",
    "instruments": "Unusually for an orchestra, it prominently features an accordion grinding out the circular main motif (reflecting the windmill man’s instrument) alongside the ocarina playing the tune. As the piece progresses, strings and brass join in to heighten the energy, and a harp adds a brief gentle interlude (echoing the tranquility before the storm). Finally, cymbals crash and deep percussion underscores the thunderous climax, truly bringing the storm to life in sound.",
    "situation": "This theme is heard in the Kakariko Windmill (and when Link conducts the Song of Storms). The orchestral version evokes the windmill’s endless turning and the conjuring of rain, encapsulating the cyclical time-loop story of how the storm was started by the very song itself.",

    "instruments": "In orchestral form, a clarinet or soft flute often carries the smooth main melody, replacing the original’s marimba with a more fluid sound. It’s supported by lush, slow-moving strings that create a wave-like, ambient backdrop. A harp might accent with gentle glissandos to suggest flowing water, and the overall instrumentation remains light and airy to preserve the peaceful, reflective mood.",
    "situation": "Plays in Zora’s Domain, the hidden aquatic home of the Zora. This music sets a peaceful, reflective mood as you wander among waterfalls and waterways, highlighting the grace and calm of the Zora’s underwater sanctuary.",
